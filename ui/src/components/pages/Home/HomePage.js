                    Podcast Network The Code Giant produces and releases new episodes for 50 different live shows. 
                    They employ more than 100 hosts and 200 producers. 
                    They attract and retain an average of 250,000 subscribers through a subscription model which allows listeners to subscribe and listen to a limited number of shows ad-free. 
                    A database driven website allows the network to keep track of which Subscribers are subscribed to which Shows, and Streams stores how many times Episodes are streamed and by which Subscribers. 
                    Maintaining a database driven website will allow The Code Giant to gather business intelligence insights that will drive marketing, advertising, and financial decisions around which shows will be renewed based on the subscriber and streaming counts.
